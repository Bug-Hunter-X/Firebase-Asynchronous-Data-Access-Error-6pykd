The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This can happen if you're using asynchronous functions and accessing the snapshot data before the promise resolves.  For example:
```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get().then(doc => {
  console.log(doc.data().myField); // Error if data hasn't loaded
});
```
