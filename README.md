# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with Firebase asynchronous operations and provides a solution.

The problem arises when attempting to access data from a Firebase document snapshot before the data has finished loading. This results in undefined values or errors. 

The solution involves properly handling the promise returned by Firebase's asynchronous methods to ensure data access only after it's available.
